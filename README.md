Problem Title
SIH 1710: Enhancing Navigation for Railway Station Facilities and Locations

Problem Description
Background: Railway stations are complex environments with numerous facilities and locations such as ticket counters, platforms, restrooms, food courts, and waiting areas. Passengers often face difficulties in navigating these spaces, especially in large or unfamiliar stations. Efficient and user-friendly navigation systems are crucial for improving passenger experience, reducing congestion, and ensuring timely travel connections. Description: The problem involves developing a comprehensive navigation solution for railway stations that assists passengers in locating various facilities and destinations within the station premises. This includes creating detailed maps, providing real-time directions, and integrating features such as accessibility options for individuals with disabilities. The solution should be intuitive, easy to use, and accessible via multiple platforms, including mobile devices and digital kiosks. Key challenges include updating navigation information in real-time, ensuring accuracy, and accommodating the diverse needs of all passengers. Expected Solution: The expected solution is a multi-platform navigation system that provides detailed, real-time directions to all facilities and locations within a railway station. This system should include: A mobile application with 3D interactive maps and step-by-step navigation. Digital kiosks located throughout the station with touch-screen interfaces. Voice-guided navigation for visually impaired passengers. Regular updates to reflect changes in station layout and facility locations. Integration with existing railway apps and services for seamless user experience. The solution should enhance the overall passenger experience by reducing confusion, saving time, and improving accessibility within the station.

Idea
To build a web/mobile application that helps users locate the nearest authorized e-waste disposal or recycling facilities based on their current location. The app promotes responsible disposal of electronic waste and spreads environmental awareness.

Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
[User App/Web Interface] | v [Location Service API] <--- GPS / IP Location | v [Backend Server/API] - Processes requests - Handles facility search | v [Database of E-Waste Facilities] | v [Map Integration (Google Maps API / Leaflet)]

Use Cases
Locate Nearest E-Waste Center User opens app → Allows location access → Nearest centers are shown on map.

Filter by E-Waste Type Users can filter centers based on what they accept (e.g., phones, TVs, batteries).

Get Facility Details Tap on a facility → See name, address, contact, open hours, and accepted materials.

Manual Search Users can search by pin code, city, or facility name.

User Feedback (Optional Enhancement) Users can rate or report outdated information about facilities.

## Technology Stack

Frontend Web: React.js / Vue.js

Mobile: Flutter / React Native

Map Integration: Google Maps API or Leaflet.js

Backend Server: Node.js with Express / Django / Flask

API: REST API for data retrieval and filtering

Database: Firebase Firestore / MongoDB / PostgreSQL

Others Location Detection: HTML5 Geolocation / GPS APIs

Hosting: Firebase, Vercel, or AWS


## Dependencies
Google Maps API – For map rendering and location search.

Geolocation API – To get user location.

Database of E-Waste Centers – You may need to integrate with:

Government open data portals (e.g., CPCB in India)

NGO databases

Manually collected or crowd-sourced data

Authentication (Optional) – Firebase Auth for user logins.

Node modules or packages – Axios, Express, Leaflet, etc.
